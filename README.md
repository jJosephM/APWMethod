# APWMethod
An attempt at an implementation of the APW Method

**Read the README.pdf for a single document overview of the project, including theory, algorithm and "documentation"**

To do:

  Reread theory
  
  Keep writing README.pdf
  
  Check spherical harmonic generator code
  
  Finish reading Bessel function paper
  
    Write Mathematia script
    
    Write rest of code for generator
    
  Pick a suitable lapack (probably Eigen)
  
  Create a sketch of the algorithm + code in pdf
