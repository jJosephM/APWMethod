# APWMethod
An attempt at an implementation of the APW Method

Read the README.pdf for a single document overview of the project, including theory, algorithm and "documentation"

Will need to check how to write a good readme I guess

To do:
  Reread theory
  Finish up README.pdf
  Write spherical harmonic generator code
  Write Bessel function (spherical) generator code
  Pick a suitable lapack (probably Eigen)
  Create a sketch of the algorithm + code
  Go
